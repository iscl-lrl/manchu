# Manchu language repository

This project is for Manchu language.
I will transcribe and annotate Manchu sentences from various sources.

## Project description

Manchu language has many untrascribed or unannotated documents and sentences. 
Transcribing them in a standard way could be useful for research and educational purposes.

## Goals

The project currently aims to annotate 50 Manchu sentences,
and possibly add more examples that we encounter during our work.
